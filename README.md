# cairn
Cairn: A collection of utility functions for loading, querying, and analysing Zarr arrays of genomic data.

Cairns are piles of rocks, typically left on the tops of mountains or ridges to provide guidance for walkers. Passersby will often throw a rock on top.

This is a collection of utility functions for analysing genomic zarr arrays of genomic data. The hard work is done by scikit-allel and sgkit, but I found myself rewriting a ton of code for each project when I needed to access, query, subset and perform various analyses. Every time I think of something, I toss a new rock on the cairn. 

As you can see, I'm fairly determined to keep true to the metaphor.
